# simulated-annealing
Simulation of simulated annealing to solve the travelling salesperson problem on a list of Indian cities. get_distances.py is a python script that pulls data using the Google Maps distance matrix api for a list of cities provided as input. This list of cities and the distance matrix data is used by the visualization.html page to perform and simulate the simulated annealing algorithm.
